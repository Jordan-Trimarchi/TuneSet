# TuneSet

When you're playing a gig, or even practicing at home, the last thing you want to be doing is messing about with song sheets, trying to remember which song comes next, and reaching away from your instrument to scroll or turn pages. These issues and more are solved using TuneSet. TuneSet lets you have access to all your song sheets in one place, sort them by artist/title, group them into set lists and quickly navigate between songs in a set with one click. 

When viewing a sheet, you can choose between a clean read-only view or a fully functional google docs instance for editing, provided you are signed into google in your browser, or the permissions for the sheet allow anyone to edit.
